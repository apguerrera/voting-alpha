- members lambda onboard function impl
  - API key auth
  - location of eth endpoint in env var (see example ref in chaincode custom resource)
  - create transaction via web3 contract
  - return status and txid after receipt available
  - note: if web3 stuff in chaincode py files are useful but can't be imported, just copy paste
  - generic functionality should go in app/common - but not too difficult to refactor later
